## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m someone who enjoys exploring the world of technology, especially programming and software development. 
I have a strong interest in GitHub and love learning different computer languages to build and share projects. 
Iâ€™m always curious about how things work behind the scenes and eager to improve my coding skills through hands-on experience.
